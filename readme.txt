 One-Page Summary of Prototype
------------------------------------
Aapka Sathi is a digital empowerment platform designed to support India's
street vendors and micro-entrepreneurs. The platform bridges the gap between
informal workers and essential resources by providing legal identity, financial
access, skill training, digital tools, and guidance on government schemes.

Through its mobile-first approach, vendors can register, verify documents,
apply for schemes, attend skill workshops, and access financial aid ‚Äî all from
a single platform. The solution fosters inclusivity, transparency, and dignity,
while creating an ecosystem for sustainable livelihood growth.

 Key Features & Functionalities

1. Vendor Registration & Digital Identity Creation
2. Access to Policy & Government Schemes (PM SVANidhi, e-Shram, etc.)
3. Skill Training Programs (e.g., Chaupal 1.0)
4. Financial Aid Facilitation (loans, subsidies, zero-balance accounts)
5. Legal & Compliance Support (CoV, FSSAI, licenses, permits)
6. Vendor Profiling, Geo-tagging, and Support Services

 Core Problem Being Addressed
------------------------------------
Street vendors often lack access to legal identity, financial inclusion,
training, and awareness of government schemes. This limits their ability to
sustain and grow their livelihoods. Aapka Sathi addresses these barriers by
creating a one-stop digital solution that ensures recognition, empowerment,
and access to opportunities.

 Overview of Prototype/Idea
------------------------------------
The prototype demonstrates a vendor-friendly mobile application with modules
for registration, document upload, scheme information, training schedules,
geo-tagging, and real-time support. Screens include dashboard, vendor profile,
scheme details, event listings, analytics, and helpdesk interface.

This end-to-end solution redefines how street vendors can connect with
government benefits, financial institutions, and skill development resources.
